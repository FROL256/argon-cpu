
SPARC:
1) The condition code register on the SPARC has four bits: Z (Zero), N (Negative), C (Carry), and V (oVerflow). 
The standard arithmetic operations (e.g., addition and subtraction) do not update the bits in the condition code register. Instead, there are special operations that update the condition code register. 
The names for these operations have a suffix of ``cc'' to indicate that they update the bits in the condition code register.
